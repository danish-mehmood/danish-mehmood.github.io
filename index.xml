The Problem Imagine you are working with a microservices architecture and you have 10s of services running, And these services work together by communicating with each other to achieve a goal.]]></description>

The Problem As i discussed in the last blog post, the communication patterns in microservices are way different than the patterns in monoliths, in monoliths the modules communicate using method calls but in case of microservices, services communicate using the network calls.]]></description>

            </div>In this blog post i discuss, How microservices communicate, and what are the common patterns followed, this post would be a primer, I will go deeper in to the different patterns in future posts]]></description>

            </div><p>API gateway is a common pattern majority of microservices out in the world follow, to address some issues and Backend for frontend is a pattern which is a natural extension of API gateway pattern which helps the microservices scale very smoothly.</p>]]></description>

            </div><p><strong>Microservices</strong> are one of the most popular methodology to develop and deploy the software systems. In popularity it is
only second to <strong>Monoliths</strong> (or Modular Monoliths).</p>
<p>This blog series is all about microservices, how do they differ from monoliths, what are their pros and cons, when do they
make sense and how to implement microservices effectively.</p>]]></description>
